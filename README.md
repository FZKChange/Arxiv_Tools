# Arxiv_Tools
A tool that combines LLMs and paper search

First, check the translation and summary models you want to use on the official website of Hugging Face **(https://huggingface.co/)**. The models I use are small in size, and there are no significant errors.

Secondly, adjust the model you want to use in the papers.py code and select the path. You can also design keywords of interest in this code, etc. I will continue to improve it later.

Finally, just run improve_gui.py directly. You can search for corresponding literature using the keywords you type. I put an example for everyone to see.
